2. Set up **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD to automatically deploy the app on each push to the `main` branch.
3. The **YAML configuration** for GitHub Actions is located in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in the repository. This configuration handles the deployment process.
   
Once the deployment process is configured, any push to the `main` branch will trigger the deployment to Azure.
